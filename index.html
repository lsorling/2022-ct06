        <h1>üòä Hey, I am Joey üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</h1>
        <p>
            I love to code. I am fascinated by web programming,
            especially CSS which refers to Cascading Stylesheet. Using CSS, I can dress up
            my webpages using colors and everything else that I can only imagine.
            With HTML, I can add photos and videos to enrich my contents. So awesome!
            <br><br>
            Nice to meet you! ‚úåÔ∏è
            <br><br>
            In this website, I will add in snipplets to share the techniques that I have
            learned. Please check back regularly for more updates!
        </p>

        <h2>Piet Mondrian</h2>
        <p>
            One day I was out shopping and I was attracted to this marketing poster of a hair salon using color
            blocking.
            I was curious about it, and I went back and start researching. It didn't take me long to find this guy
            named "Piet Mondrian".
        </p>
        <h3>Color Blocking</h3>
        <p>
            Color blocking has been around for around 10 decades. Piet Mondrian was the first artist to really
            popularize the idea of color blocking.
            Piet Mondrian introduced color blocking in the 1930's by creating works using vibrant colors separated by
            thick black lines making squares of different colors, most commonly, blue, red, yellow, the primary colors;
            and white, and black. This new vision for modern art had profound effects on the artistic world, as well as,
            the
            fashion world.
        </p>
        <h3>Color Theory</h3>
        <p>
            This is an important aspect when it comes to web programming. I am still learning how to get it right.
            Do you like the colors that I have chosen for my Portfolio? How many colors did I use?
